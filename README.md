# SymbolicThreeBodyDecays.jl

This repository provides a Julia implementation that extends the functionality of the [ThreeBodyDecay.jl](https://github.com/mmikhasenko/ThreeBodyDecay.jl) project to work with SymPy objects. It allows for symbolic computation in the context of three-body decays.

## Features:
- **Symbolic Computation**: Seamlessly integrate with SymPy to perform symbolic calculations related to three-body decays.
- **Demo with Pluto**: The `demo` folder contains Pluto.jl notebooks that provide interactive demonstrations or examples to help users understand the functionality. To run the notebooks, ensure you have [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) installed and simply open them using Pluto.

## Getting Started:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mmikhasenko/SymbolicThreeBodyDecays.jl.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `demo` folder and open the Pluto notebooks for interactive examples.
3. For detailed functionality, explore the `src` directory.
